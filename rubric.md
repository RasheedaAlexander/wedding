## Project Workflow
Performing/Progressing - Wireframes are a little light, maybe map out some more potential views moving forward. Also ERD's are the lynchpin of any web app. Your ERD's had these weird diamond looking things and I wasn't really sure what they signified. It would also be great if you fleshed out your readme with installation procedures and short/long goalds.

## Technical Requirements
Performing/Progressing - There are 3 models in your applications; however, there are no associations between those models. Your user model currently only exists as a barrier to entry. It'd be really nice if you incorporated the use model in your application a bit more. I really like this domain model and think this app could be great.

## Code Quality
Performing/Progressing - Your controller code is scaffolded and as such have scaffolded comments and unused files in your codebase. I would encourage you to write this app from scratch not using scaffold. Especially since you want to incorporate associations, which is much harder to do with scaffolding since theres no real "standardized" way to do it.

## Creativity Interface
Performing/Progressing - Like I said before, the user model in your app currently is just a barrier to entry and serves no real purpose except for the viewing of content. The blanket authenticate user makes it so a user must always be logged in. It'd be cool if non-users could view stuff, but only create things if you're a user. I do like the popups for the image, that was a nice touch.
