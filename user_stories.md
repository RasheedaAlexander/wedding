As a bride I want to:
1. sign up for a destination wedding account so that I can easily track my wedding's components
2. view different resorts so that I can see which one best suits my budget
3. view the vendors associated with each resort so that I can view the pricing for their services
4. view each resort's/vendor's website so that I can learn more about their business, reviews, and previous work
5. add/edit/delete resorts/vendors so that I can make the desired changes to my choices
6. zoom in on the resort's/vendor's picture so that I can get a closer look
7. edit/delete my account information in case I no longer need to use this service or make changes to my email or password
